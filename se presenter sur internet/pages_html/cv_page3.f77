			my professional project is to become an IT security engineer 
			because IT is a field that I love and there is more and more work being created because 
			Nowadays, companies are moving towards total computerization of data and it 
			They must be secure so that people with bad intentions cannot 
			jeopardize the company.
			I think it's an essential job these days and my passion for IT 
			encourages me to achieve my professional goal.
		</li>
		<li class="project">
			what I like about this position is that it will allow me to use
			my imagination in order to find better ways to secure our computer
			data and to continue working with passion on a task that everyone need.
